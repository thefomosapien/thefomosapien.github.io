					<p>Billing Simplified was always meant to serve those in the medical industry by removing the stress of a tedius billing process. Our team was unaware that our client had a very clear vision for what it should become - a reporting tool for practice owners to see the financial health of their business. It makes perfect sense in hind sight and I was beyond excited that we were able to implement very cool visuals. With the second iteration came some interesting tweaks to the data flow and overall design of the web app.</p>

					<p>With a team of five and two weeks to deliver a functional beta of Billing Simplified, we had some impoirtant choices confronting us. We were able to implement multiple logins with different permissions/views using resolves. We could now store multiple practices with their own patients/bills populating. I knew we needed a clear path of execution for the users sake and also for an intuitive backend. After meeting with our client several times, I decided the flow should look like this: Practice -> Patient -> Bill -> Payment. I took lead on designing the UX/UI, building with pure HTML/CSS (with help from Gulp/Sass), a majority of the Angular functionality & of course JavaScript to manipulate the data. Graphs and charts are the last piece of the Billing Simplified puzzle. For that we used D3.js.</p>

					<p>A doctor friend approached me with a problem in his industry. The billing process for medical businesses is fragmented, slow, and lacks a decent mode of communication. Just last year he was on the verge of bankruptcy and almost lost his practice. He hired a billing company like most small-to-medium sized practices will do. The billing company rarely communicated, often made mistakes and never held themselves accountable. The idea for Billing Simplified was born.</p>

					<p>The first iteration of Billing Simplified was simply a prototype. It was important to my client that he have a proof-of-concept, a functional and basic version of his ultimate vision. I knew that his web app should be streamlined, with a clear path of execution for whoever uses it. I used the MEAN stack to build two portals, one for practice staff and the other for billing (my client's business). In the two weeks I had to build it, I was able to build a functional data entry system for both patients and payments, an invoice template and a not-yet-functional but styled chat system. He was so impressed with the first iteration that I was able to lead a team to the next iteration.</p>

					<p>DT Customs is a premier small-town mechanic shop in Hanford, CA. The owner happens to be my uncle. He contacted me after learning about my new skills in web development. He had been paying a service for a very basic website with some static information. It wasn't inviting or sleek at all. I jumped at the opportunity to help him and continue learning my craft.</p>

					<p>The site started with the foundational technologies, HTML/CSS, JS, & Angular. I decided to try out Materialize for the styling. It proved useful on a 1-week deadline, speeding up the design process considerably. I realized that people who visit the site may want to contact the shop in-line so I built a contact form. I learned to use FireBase and was able to make it totally functional, storing the data and displaying it on an Admin page.</p>
