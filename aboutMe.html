                        <h5>More about me</h5>
                        <p><span class="image left"><img src="assets/css/images2/giphy.gif" alt="" /></span>I grew up in a small town called Hanford, California. Throughout my youth I was dyseducated by my peers to hate where we lived, a "podunk" town in
                            the middle of a valley in a state associated with celebrities and the beach. In reality, my circumstances there instilled a hunger within myself. A thirst for experiencing the world and making discoveries about myself. I've
                            always been a creative. I love making music, movies, writing and designing. I had a band in high school called... wait for it... Finding Emo. Can you believe that? Nonetheless, I've always enjoyed creating for others. After
                            high school, based on my love of movies, I decided to pursue a career as an actor. I moved to Santa Monica and was paying $900 for a 500 square foot studio about 10 blocks from the beach. I got one official acting gig while
                            there, a part on a reality show called Parental Control. Soon thereafter I ran out of money and moved back to Hanford. This was a pivitol moment in my life when I decided to go on a religious mission for the LDS church. I lived
                            and prosylated in Cleveland, OH for two years. It turned out to be an incredibly rewarding experience in which I met my future wife and future client, with whom I've worked for as a web developer. During the hectic preparations
                            for our wedding, I remember thinking, "I wish we could create a central location where all of our guests can get our wedding information." Thus began my foray into programming. I ended up working all through the night, totally
                            devouring any information on HTML/CSS I could find. From there I continued to dabble in my new found hobby and build websites for friends and family. All the while I've stuttered along in the sales and marketing industry. A
                            year ago I decided to take programming seriously and I dove head first into JavaScript. For the past 5 months I've been a student at DevMountain, a coding bootcamp in Provo, UT. I've been learning the MEAN stack, a little React,
                            Gulp, Sass, D3.js, Jquery, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap, unit testing, FireBase, UX/UI, LocalAuth, OAuth, hosting, socketIO and BigO notation. I'd say my most valuable takeaway from DevMountain was the ability I gained to teach myself
                            new things and learning to learn difficult concepts on my own.</p>

                        <p>I love to dance, my favorite movie is Mary Poppins. I have a beautiful 2-year old son and a new daughter on the way. Recently, during my two-hour train commutes, I've discovered an affinity for reading. I just finished a book called
                            <i>Siddhartha</i>. A profound portrait of human life. Before that, I discovered my #1 favorite book: <i>Blue Rage, Black Redemption</i> by Stanley "Tookie" Williams. Tookie is a hero of mine because he was able to escape his
                            own hell and find redemption in learning, forgiveness and service. My life, much like programming, has been a sequence of trial and error. A constant road of redemption and learning.
